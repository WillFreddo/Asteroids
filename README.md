# Asteroids

Welcome to my first game made using the help of boot.dev.

I followed their course to get the game working however I am pushing myself to add extra additions to help my own learning. 
The extras I have added are:
    - Asteroid kill counter
    - Game over screen - exit key not working...
    - Scoring system + saved highscore
    - Screen Wrapping
    - Upgrades - currently rotate and pickupable but do nothing. These will be:
            - Yellow   -    Movement speed
            - Red      -    Shooting Speed
            - Blue     -    Bullet Size
            - Green    -    Bullet Pierce

As of Boss update + patch
    - New upgrade
            - Purple   -    Bullet Damage * Currently dont spawn
    - Boss Asteroids added every 50 spawns

    movement speed, shooting speed and bullet pierce are now functional. balancing to be completed at later date

My to do list:
    - Implement upgrades
    - More visuals for upgrades
    - fix game over screen
        - include way to reset highscore
    - Visual for upgrades
    - Change boss spawn pattern
    - fix boss bounces
    - add boss health bars underneath 
    - life system?
    - restart from game over?
